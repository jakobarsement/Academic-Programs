The relevant program does not appear to satisfy the diff command test on
the creator's machine, contrary to the close analysis of .dis and
.out file outputs. Many students have been consulted, along with tutors,
and this program appears to satisfy all requirements of the program outline.

Advice on this issue is welcomed.
